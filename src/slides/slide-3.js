          · Results first. · I strive to deliver strong results rather than
          rushing the outcome to finish a set deadline. · Planning a project to
          an exact date is near impossible so I’m happy to put in extra time to
          deliver great work. · That said that doesn’t mean I miss important
          deadlines as I work fast with my decade of design experience.
